# Regression Models - Coursera

Below, the course description copied from the course [page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models?specialization=jhu-data-science)


## Course Description

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist's toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

Book: Regression Models for Data Science in R

A companion book is available here: https://leanpub.com/regmods

The book is published via leanpub, and the suggested price is $14.99. You can get it for free or pay what you feel it is worth. 
Quizzes

- There are four weekly quizzes.
- You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz
- You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours.
- The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

Course Project

The Course Project is an opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have learned during the course. It is graded through peer assessment. You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass the peer assessment.
Grading Policy

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Project) to pass the course.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

- Quiz 1 = 15%
- Quiz 2 = 15%
- Quiz 3 = 15%
- Quiz 4 = 15%
- Course Project = 40%
- swirl Programming Assignment (optional)

In this course, you have the option to use the swirl R package to practice some of the concepts we cover in lectures.

While these lessons will give you valuable practice and you are encouraged to complete as many as possible, please note that they are completely optional and you can get full marks in the class without completing them.
