# Project Instructions

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* â€œIs an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG""
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"  

## Review criteria

### Peer Grading

* The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below.
* Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)

### Criteria

* Did the student interpret the coefficients correctly?
* Did the student do some exploratory data analyses?
* Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection?
* Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable?
* Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics?
* Did the student quantify the uncertainty in their conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly?
