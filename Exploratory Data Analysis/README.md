# Exploratory Data Analysis - Coursera

Below, the course description copied from the coursera [page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis)


### Course Description

This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

### Course Content:

- Making exploratory graphs

- Principles of analytic graphics

- Plotting systems and graphics devices in R

- The base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R

- Clustering methods

- Dimension reduction techniques

### Course Textbook

The book Exploratory Data Analysis with R covers the lecture material in this course.

### Weekly quizzes

- There are two quizzes (Weeks 1 and 2).

- You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz.

- You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours.

- The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

### The Course Projects

The two course projects will be assessed via peer assessment. In these projects, you will be asked to construct or reproduce certain plots, the purpose of which is to make you familiar with various plotting options. You will be evaluated on the plot that you produce and the code that you write to construct the plot. Course projects evaluated via peer assessment will make use of your GitHub account. 

For each Course Project, you are required to evaluate and grade at least four of your classmates' projects. 
Grading policy

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Projects) to pass the course.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

- Quiz 1 = 20%

- Quiz 2 = 20%

- Course Project 1 = 25%

- Course Project 2 = 35%
