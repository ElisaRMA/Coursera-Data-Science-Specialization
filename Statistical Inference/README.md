# Statistical Inference - Coursera

Below, the course description copied from the course [page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference?specialization=jhu-data-science)


## Course Description

In this class students will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.

## Course Book

There's now a (sort of) book for the class. It's a different sort of book published on LeanPub. If you purchase the book on LeanPub, you'll get all editions in the future for free. You pick the price on the site. You can get it here:

https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook

However, you can also just read a web page rendering of the book here: https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook/read

In addition, the book is on github if you want to render it yourself using pandoc https://github.com/bcaffo/LittleInferenceBook
Github repository

The most up to date information on the course lecture notes will always be in the Github repository

(https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/tree/master/06_StatisticalInference) 

Please issue pull requests so that we may improve the materials. Notice that Brian's forked github repo is sometimes out of sync with the Data Science Specialization repo managed by the other instructors. Make sure to check in Brian's master repo for the most up to date material.

## Quizzes
* There are four quizzes.
* You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz.
* You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours.
* The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

The quizzes will cover the material from that week. The quizzes don't always exactly correspond to the material for that week. However, the material is always covered before the quiz is due. Here's the rough makeup

   - Quiz 1 covers lectures 1 - 4
   - Quiz 2 covers lectures 5 - 7 
   - Quiz 3 covers lectures 8 - 10 
   - Quiz 4 covers lectures 8 - 13

Thus, Quiz 3 and 4 cover a lot of overlapping material.


## Course Project

The Course Project is an opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have learned during the course. It is graded through peer assessment.
Grading policy

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Project) to pass the course.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

   - Quiz 1 = 15% 
   - Quiz 2 = 15% 
   - Quiz 3 = 15% 
   - Quiz 4 = 15%
   - Course project = 40%

--------------------------

For this course, one project was developed, that should be divided into two parts:

- [Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Statistical%20Inference/Project%20Instructions.md) 
- [Part 1 - Simulation Data](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Statistical%20Inference/Statistical%20Inference%20Project%20-%20Simulation%20Data.pdf) 
- [Part 2 - Data Analysis](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Statistical%20Inference/Statistical%20Inference%20Project%20-%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)
