# Practical Machine Learning - Coursera

Below, the course description copied from the course [page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning?specialization=jhu-data-science)


## Course Description

One of the most common tasks performed by data scientists and data analysts are prediction and machine learning. This course will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course will provide basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. The course will also introduce a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course will cover the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.


## Course Content

* Prediction study design

* In sample and out of sample errors

* Overfitting

* Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves

* The caret package in R

* Preprocessing and feature creation

* Prediction with regression

* Prediction with decision trees

* Prediction with random forests

* Boosting

* Prediction blending

## Weekly quizzes

* There are three weekly quizz* 
* You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a q* 
* You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hou* 
* The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

## The Course Project

The Course Project has two parts:

Course Project Writeup: This peer-assessed portion of the Course Project in Practical Machine Learning is worth 20% of the final grade.

Course Project Prediction Quiz: This prediction programming portion of the Course Project is also worth 20% of your final grade. 

You must earn a grade of at least 80% on both portions to pass the Course Project. 


## Grading Policy

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Project) to pass the course.

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

* Quiz 1 = 15%
* Quiz 2 = 15%
* Quiz 3 = 15%
* Quiz 4 = 15%
* Course Project Writeup (peer-assessed) = 20%
* Course Project Submission (programming) = 20%
