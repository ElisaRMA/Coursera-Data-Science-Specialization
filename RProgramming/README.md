# R programming - Coursera

For the R programming course 3 projects were developed

1. Air Pollution
2. Lexical Scoping
3. Hospital Quality

The instructions for each project are:

1. [Project 1 - Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/Project%201%20-%20Instructions.md)
2. [Project 2 - Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/Project%202%20-%20Instructions.md)
3. [Project 3 - Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/Project%203%20-%20Instructions.md  )

The functions created for each projects are:

1. [pollutantmean](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/pollutantmean.R) (Project 1)
2. [complete](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/complete.R) (Project 1)
3. [corr](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/corr.R) (Project 1)
4. [cachematrix](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/cachematrix.R) (Project 2)

For Project 2, the creation of a github repo was also required. The repo should contain the cachematrix function modified. The repo was forked and modified accordingly and the link to it can be found [here](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/ProgrammingAssignment2)
