# R programming - Coursera

Below, the R programming course description copied from the course


### Course Description

In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis and optimization will provide working examples.
Course Content

- Week 1: Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data

- Week 2: Control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times

- Week 3: Loop functions, debugging tools

- Week 4: Simulation, code profiling

### Background lectures

Background lectures about the content of the course with respect to other quantitative courses, course logistics, and the R programming language are provided as reference material. It is not necessary to watch the videos to complete the course, however you may find them useful.


### Course Textbook

The book R Programming for Data Science covers all of the lecture material in this course.

### Assessments
#### Quizzes

- There are four weekly quizzes. 

- You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz.

- You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours.

- The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

#### Programming Assignments

- There are three required programming assignments.

- You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a programming assignment 

- Programming Assignments 1 and 3 are graded via unit tests using a submission script that compares the output of your functions to the correct output.

- Programming Assignment 2 is submitted differently and graded via a peer review.

#### swirl Programming Assignment (practice)

- In this course, you have the option to use the swirl R package to practice some of the concepts we cover in lectures.

- While these lessons will give you valuable practice and you are encouraged to complete as many as possible, please note that they are completely optional and you can get full marks in the class without completing them.

 
###Grading Policy

You must score at least 80% on all required assignments (Quizzes & Programming Assignments) to pass the course. Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

- Week 1 Quiz - 20%

- Week 2 Quiz - 10%

- Week 3 Quiz - 5%

- Week 4 Quiz - 10%

- Programming Assignment 1 (Air Pollution) - 20%

- Programming Assignment 2 (Lexical Scoping) - 10%

- Programming Assignment 3 (Hospital Quality) - 25%

- swirl Programming Assignment (practice) - 0%

For the R programming course 3 projects were developed

1. Air Pollution
2. Lexical Scoping
3. Hospital Quality

The instructions for each project are:

1. [Project 1 - Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/Project%201%20-%20Instructions.md)
2. [Project 2 - Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/Project%202%20-%20Instructions.md)
3. [Project 3 - Instructions](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/Project%203%20-%20Instructions.md  )

The functions created for each projects are:

1. [pollutantmean](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/pollutantmean.R) (Project 1)
2. [complete](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/complete.R) (Project 1)
3. [corr](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/corr.R) (Project 1)
4. [cachematrix](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/RProgramming/cachematrix.R) (Project 2)

For Project 2, the creation of a github repo was also required. The repo should contain the cachematrix function modified. The repo was forked and modified accordingly and the link to it can be found [here](https://github.com/ElisaRMA/ProgrammingAssignment2)
