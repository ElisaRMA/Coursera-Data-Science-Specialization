# Developing Data Products - Coursera 

Below, the course description copied from the course [page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products?specialization=jhu-data-science)

## Course Description 

A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience. 

In this class students will learn a variety of core tools for creating data products in R and R Studio in specific. Students will be evaluated via quizzes and a culminating project. 
Course Content 

The lectures will be taught over four weeks with the third week dedicated to creating R packages. 

The weeks are organized as follows

1. Shiny, rCharts, manipulate, googleVis 
2. Presenting data analysis, slidify, R Studio presenter. 
3. Students creating and deploying their projects 
4. Creating R packages, classes and methods, yhat.

## Book: Developing Data Products in R 

This book introduces the topic of Developing Data Products in R. A data product is the ideal output of a Data Science experiment. This book is based on the Coursera Class “Developing Data Products” as part of the Data Science Specialization. Particular emphasis is paid to developing Shiny apps and interactive graphics. 

The book is available here: https://leanpub.com/ddp 

It’s variable pricing, including free! It also includes some content (like leaflet) that was not covered in the class and omits some other. It’s a little rough, but as I work on it you’ll get all of the updates.

## Weekly quizzes

- There are three weekly quizzes. 
- You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass a quiz 
- You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours. 
- The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade

## Course Project 

The Course Project is an opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have learned during the course. It is graded through peer assessment. You must earn a grade of at least 80% to pass the course project.

## Grading policy 

You must score at least 80% on all assignments (Quizzes & Project) to pass the course. 

Your final grade will be calculated as follows: 

- Quiz 1 = 20% 
- Quiz 2 = 20% 
- Quiz 3 = 20% 
- Course project = 40%
