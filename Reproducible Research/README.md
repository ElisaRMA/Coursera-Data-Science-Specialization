In this course you will learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, publish reproducible documents to the web, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.

Course Content:

   - Structuring and organizing a data analysis

   - Markdown and R Markdown

   - knitr / RPubs

   - Reproducible research check list

   - Evidence-based data analysis

   - Case studies in air pollution epidemiology and high-throughput biology

## Course Book

The book Report Writing for Data Science in R serves as the official course reference textbook. It comes in electronic form (PDF, ePub, and mobi) and is available from Leanpub. The book contains the lecture material for the course and can serve as a reference for you once the course is completed.
Assessments
Quizzes

    There are two quizzes (Weeks 1 and 2).

    You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times in 8 hours.

    The score from your most successful attempt will count toward your final grade.

## Course Projects

The Course Projects focus on plotting and will be assessed via peer assessment. In these assignments, you will be asked to conduct data analysis and you will be evaluated by your classmates on the work and code that you write. Assignments evaluated via peer assessment will make use of your GitHub account or the RPubs web site.
